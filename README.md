# [Unicorn Attractor](https://unicorn-attractor-tou.herokuapp.com/)

The brief for this assignment was to produce an app which served my theoretical
business model of providing a service to my users by fixing their 
programming bugs for free and creating features which my users have suggested 
for a price.

As I am now theoretically a fully-fledged full stack developer, I am capable of
extinguishing several theoretical programming fires and producing several 
theoretical features to add to my website. Unicorn Attractor is the place where
any new or experienced programmer can post and share any problems they are experiencing 
or whether they have any new, bright and innovative ideas for new features to be
implemented on the site.

In addition to sharing issues and new feature ideas users also have a profile
where they can upload their own photos as a profile picture and all the issues
and ideas which they've posted will show up on their page.

This is also a social platform for users as they have the ability to comment
on each others issues or features for free.
