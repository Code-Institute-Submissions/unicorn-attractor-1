<h1><a href="https://unicorn-attractor-tou.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Unicorn Attractor</a></h1>

The brief for this assignment was to produce an app which served my theoretical
business model of providing a service to my users by fixing their 
programming bugs for free and creating features which my users have suggested 
for a price. 

As I am now theoretically a fully-fledged full stack developer, I am capable of
extinguishing several theoretical programming fires and producing several 
theoretical features to add to my website. Unicorn Attractor is the place where
any new or experienced programmer can post and share any problems they are experiencing 
or whether they have any new, bright and innovative ideas for new features to be
implemented on the site.

In addition to sharing issues and new feature ideas users also have a profile
where they can upload their own photos as a profile picture and all the issues
and ideas which they've posted will show up on their page.

This is also a social platform for users as they have the ability to comment
on each others issues or features for free.

# UX

The target audience for this application (app) is directed at all developers, from users who
have little or no experience to advanced developers or who generally have
any software related questions.  

This particular site would be useful for those who want to share their issues
or search for problems already posted by users currently experiencing or having
experienced similar issues already. Users can find effective solutions from
either myself or other users commenting on their issue. However, if you don't have
a solution or just want to get your ideas across, you can comment nonetheless.

In addition to posting bugs that need fixing, this app is also available for those
who want to request new features to be developed by myself. Any user can request
or post as many features as they please however, only the requests which receive
the highest number of votes per month will be developed by myself.

I believe my project is one of the best ways a user can find or solve their issue
as an author of an issue can display whether or not their issue has been fixed
or their request has been developed by the touch of a button. You can also comment
if you have any further questions or just want to chat.
